# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

Got the code and was able to change the div tags to semantic elements. Cleaned up the CSS code to be more streamline. Made sure all the link tags would navigate to the right area of the page. Removed the class tags on the div tags once I made them semantic.

- What was your motivation?
  Wanted to do as much as I could on my own before asking a tutor for help, only needed a few things with him. The tutors name is Andres Jimenez he was very helpful in explaining things that you can change.
- Why did you build this project?
  I wanted to make sure I could read the code and change it to what it should be to read more clean.
- What problem does it solve?
  Makes the code more streamline and user freindly for other coders to see the code.
- What did you learn?
  It is much easier to read the code when all the div tags are semantic so you can understand what they do.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

I didn't install the website, just refactored it.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

One of the students gave me a good idea on how to change and consolidate the code to look better. Can't remember her name, but that got me started in the write direction. And I was able to help a few people go in the right direction as well without doing it for them. Andres Jimenez tutor who helped me polish the last few things on the HW.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
